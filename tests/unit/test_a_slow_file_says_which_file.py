"""UX-418: the half of the tier partition that needs a measurement.

`UX-403`'s guard census mutated one guard per family and watched it go
red. Ten of eleven did; the one that did not was
`test_the_tiers_are_a_partition.py`, under *a large file demoted to no
tier*:

```text
tier partition               GREEN    14 passed in 0.58s
```

Deleting a **fifty-second** entry from `LARGE` changed nothing, because
`small` is the default: a file that belongs in a tier and is absent
from both lists reads as "small on purpose".

`tools/dev_tier_drift.py` closes it by reading the timings the CI suite
already writes. This file guards the tool, and it guards it the way the
tool has to be guarded: **against synthetic reports**, so a clause can
assert the failing case without a fifty-second file existing to produce
it. The real run is in CI; what is checked here is that the rule reads
the floors, names the file, and can fail.
